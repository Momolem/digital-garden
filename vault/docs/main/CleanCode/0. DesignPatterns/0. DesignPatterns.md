# Design Patterns
**Design patterns**Â are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code
## Creational
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [Factory](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Factory.md)
- [Abstract Factory](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Abstract%20Factory.md)
- [Builder](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Builder.md)
- [Prototype](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Prototype.md)
- [Singleton](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Singleton.md)
## Structural
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [Adapter](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Adapter.md)
- [Bridge](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Bridge.md)
- [Composite](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Composite.md)
- [Decorator](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Decorator.md)
- [Facade](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Facade.md)
- [Flyweight](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Flyweight.md)
- [Proxy](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Proxy.md)
## Behavioral
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- [Chain of Responsibility](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Chain%20of%20Responsibility.md)
- [Command](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Command.md)
- [Iterator](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Iterator.md)
- [Mediator](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Mediator.md)
- [Memento](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Memento.md)
- [Observer](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Observer.md)
- [State](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/State.md)
- [Strategy](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Strategy.md)
- [Template Method](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Template%20Method.md)
- [Visitor](docs/main/CleanCode/0.%20DesignPatterns/Visitor.md)
