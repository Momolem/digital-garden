# Design Patterns
**Design patterns**Â are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code
## Creational
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [Factory](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Factory)
- [Abstract Factory](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Abstract%20Factory)
- [Builder](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Builder)
- [Prototype](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Prototype)
- [Singleton](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Singleton)
## Structural
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [Adapter](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Adapter)
- [Bridge](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Bridge)
- [Composite](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Composite)
- [Decorator](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Decorator)
- [Facade](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Facade)
- [Flyweight](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Flyweight)
- [Proxy](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Proxy)
## Behavioral
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- [Chain of Responsibility](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Chain%20of%20Responsibility)
- [Command](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Command)
- [Iterator](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Iterator)
- [Mediator](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Mediator)
- [Memento](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Memento)
- [Observer](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Observer)
- [State](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/State)
- [Strategy](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Strategy)
- [Template Method](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Template%20Method)
- [Visitor](/docs/main/CleanCode/DesignPatterns/Visitor)
